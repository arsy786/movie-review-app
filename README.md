# Movie Review App

This repository serves as a pointer to the [Movie Review App](https://gitlab.com/arsy7861/movie-review-app) project on GitLab.

## About the Project

The Movie Review App is a web application created following the tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org: [Full Stack Development with Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB â€“ Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). 

The primary purpose of this project is to develop my DevOps skills, specifically focusing on:

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Application deployment on platforms such as Render (PaaS) and AWS (IaaS)

## Project Goals

1. **Learn and Implement CI/CD Pipelines:**
   - Automate testing and deployment processes.
   - Ensure high-quality code with consistent integration and delivery practices.

2. **Deploying Applications:**
   - Gain hands-on experience with deploying applications on Render.
   - Understand the intricacies of deploying and managing applications on AWS.
